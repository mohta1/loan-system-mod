# TASK-12 — Disbursement Request and Capacity Reservation

    ## Objective

    Implement disbursement creation and the LoanAccount-owned capacity reservation protocol, including concurrency protection against over-commitment.

    ## Dependencies

    - `TASK-11`

    ## Required Reference Documents
- `docs/loan-system-source-scope.md`
- `docs/loan-system-mvp-scope.md`
- `docs/loan-system-requirements.md`
- `docs/loan-system-scope-alignment.md`
- `docs/loan-system-aggregate-design.md`
- `docs/loan-system-event-storming.md`
- `docs/loan-system-module-contracts.md`
- `docs/loan-system-persistence-design.md`

    ## Backend Scope

    - Implement Disbursement aggregate creation in PendingCapacity.
- Publish `DisbursementCapacityRequestedV1` reliably.
- Implement LoanAccount reservation behavior and Reservation entity.
- Publish Reserved/Rejected response events.
- Handle response idempotently in Disbursements.
- Implement create/get/search disbursement endpoints with HTTP Idempotency-Key.
- Implement platform idempotency store if not yet present.

    ## Frontend Scope

    - Create Disbursements list/detail/request form from Loan detail.
- Show AvailableToDisburse and PendingCapacity/Requested/Rejected capacity states.
- Handle asynchronous reservation result gracefully.

    ## Persistence / Infrastructure Scope

    - Create Disbursements tables, LoanAccount reservation table, platform idempotency table, relevant Outbox/Inbox migrations.

    ## Required Tests

    - Domain tests for capacity invariant and duplicate reservation.
- Mandatory concurrent integration test: 100,000 capacity, simultaneous 70,000 + 50,000 never overcommits.
- Idempotency tests for duplicate HTTP request and duplicate event.
- Integration tests for insufficient capacity and invalid loan state.
- Frontend tests for request form and async status.
- E2E smoke creates a valid disbursement reservation.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    - [ ] `TotalDisbursed + Reserved <= ApprovedAmount` always holds.
- [ ] Concurrent requests cannot overcommit.
- [ ] Duplicate create requests cannot create duplicate logical disbursements.
- [ ] All quality and coverage gates pass.

## Scope / Documentation Alignment Requirements

- Implement the Scope Alignment financing-type change before disbursement: an authorized change is allowed only before any active disbursement reservation/payment, only to a type allowed by the approved product version, and must be audited. It must not silently increase approved amount or bypass eligibility/reapproval constraints.
- Capture contractor/property-owner beneficiary and required bank/payment details as a payment beneficiary snapshot; do not log sensitive bank data unnecessarily.
- Preserve the LoanAccount-owned capacity invariant.

## Required Manual UI Scenarios to Report

Codex must include detailed step-by-step manual UI verification for at least these task-specific scenarios in its final report:

- Create a disbursement within available loan capacity and verify PendingCapacity becomes Requested after reservation.
- Request an amount above available capacity and verify rejection.
- Double-submit/retry the same create action and verify no duplicate logical disbursement is created.
- Before any reservation/payment, change financing type to another type allowed by the approved product and verify it is audited.
- After a reservation exists, attempt the same financing-type change and verify the unsafe change is blocked.
- Verify contractor/property-owner beneficiary/bank information is captured for the payment flow.

## Mandatory Execution Protocol

Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip a gate.

### 0. Verify Dependencies and Sync Git

Before any code change:

- verify every task listed in **Dependencies** has already been reviewed by the user and merged to `main`;
- do not continue from a previous task branch;
- start from the latest merged `main`.

```bash
git status
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

If the working tree is dirty or the pull cannot fast-forward, **stop and report the issue**. Do not reset, discard, stash, overwrite, or merge user work automatically.

Create a fresh branch for this task:

```bash
git switch -c task/12-disbursement-capacity
```

Direct feature implementation on `main` is forbidden.

### 1. Mandatory Documentation / Scope Consistency Gate

Before editing code, read at minimum:

```text
docs/loan-system-source-scope.md
docs/loan-system-mvp-scope.md
docs/loan-system-requirements.md
docs/loan-system-scope-alignment.md
```

Then read **all Required Reference Documents listed in this task** and inspect the current implementation/tests.

Apply this implementation precedence:

```text
Source Scope
  ↓
Explicit approved MVP Scope decisions
  ↓
Scope Alignment decisions
  ↓
Requirements / Domain / Architecture documents
  ↓
Task file
```

The source Scope is the full requirement baseline; an item may be omitted from the current implementation only when an approved MVP decision explicitly defers/simplifies it.

Before coding, perform a short consistency check:

- confirm the task does not contradict the source Scope;
- confirm it does not re-introduce an explicitly deferred feature;
- confirm it respects Context Map, aggregates, state machines, module contracts, API and persistence boundaries;
- confirm the technical stack remains ASP.NET Core + React/TypeScript + Microsoft SQL Server + REST API + Modular Monolith;
- confirm external full-scope integrations remain behind their approved abstractions.

If a genuine contradiction is found that is not resolved by `loan-system-scope-alignment.md`, **stop before implementation and report it**. Do not silently invent a competing business rule.

### 2. Implement the Smallest Complete Vertical Slice

Complete the task end-to-end:

```text
Database / Migration (when required)
        ↓
Domain
        ↓
Application
        ↓
Infrastructure
        ↓
REST API
        ↓
React UI
        ↓
Automated Tests
```

Do not leave placeholder TODO implementations inside task scope.

For every new user-visible UI string:

- provide English and Arabic resources;
- verify English LTR and Arabic RTL behavior;
- do not put authoritative business rules only in React.

### 3. Automated Test Gate

Run all existing tests plus tests added by the task.

Backend baseline:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build --no-restore
dotnet test --no-build
```

Frontend baseline:

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test -- --run
```

Use the package-manager commands standardized by TASK-00 if different.

Integration tests must use the repository-standard real SQL Server container/Testcontainers setup rather than replacing relational behavior with an in-memory fake.

### 4. Coverage Gate

Coverage must be measured.

Minimum task gate:

- **new/changed backend business code:** >= 90% line coverage;
- **Domain/Application code introduced by the task:** target >= 95%;
- **new/changed frontend logic/components:** >= 85% line coverage;
- overall coverage must not materially regress;
- critical business invariants, authorization, negative states, concurrency and idempotency paths must have explicit tests even if numeric coverage is already high.

Generated migrations/OpenAPI clients/generated files may be excluded where appropriate.

Do not add meaningless tests solely to inflate coverage.

### 5. Local Quality Gate

Backend:

```bash
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

Also run configured analyzers and architecture tests.

Frontend:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test -- --run
npm run build
```

Review explicitly for:

- DDD aggregate/invariant correctness;
- Clean Architecture dependency direction;
- no cross-module DbContext/table access;
- cross-module reads through contracts and state changes through approved events;
- no business logic in endpoints or React components;
- no duplicated rules or magic values;
- no secrets/sensitive data in source or logs;
- appropriate concurrency/idempotency;
- English/Arabic localization and RTL behavior;
- no shortcut that makes a known deferred source requirement materially harder to add later.

### 6. Restart the Application and Leave It Ready for User Testing

After implementation and local automated gates pass, restart the complete local application so the user can test the exact task branch.

Preferred full-stack sequence:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps
```

Do **not** use `down -v` unless the task explicitly requires/describes a destructive clean-database test. Preserve normal development volumes/data.

If the repository-standard workflow runs API/React locally for hot reload, restart those processes as well; the final state must still have the relevant API/UI/database running and healthy.

Verify and report:

- SQL Server health;
- API readiness;
- frontend availability;
- OpenAPI URL;
- relevant login/test role information without exposing secrets.

Run the task happy-path smoke scenario and at least one negative scenario against the real running API/UI.

**Leave the application running and ready for the user's manual UI verification at the end of the task.**

### 7. Prepare Manual UI Test Scenarios for the User

The final report must contain a section named exactly:

```text
Manual UI Test Scenarios
```

For every scenario provide:

1. scenario name;
2. required login role/user type;
3. preconditions/test data;
4. exact page/menu/URL to open;
5. step-by-step actions/clicks/data to enter;
6. expected visible result;
7. what must **not** happen;
8. cleanup/reset step if needed.

Include the task-specific manual scenarios listed earlier in this file. Cover at minimum the main happy path and a meaningful negative/permission/validation/state scenario where applicable.

### 8. Commit, Push, Open Pull Request — Never Merge

Only after local tests, coverage, quality and runtime smoke checks pass:

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete TASK-12 disbursement-capacity"
git push -u origin task/12-disbursement-capacity
```

Create a Pull Request from the task branch to `main` using GitHub tooling available in the environment.

The PR description must summarize:

- task scope;
- source/architecture documents reviewed;
- migrations;
- tests and coverage;
- manual UI scenarios;
- known limitations/deferred source items touched.

**Codex must never merge the Pull Request.**

If CI is available, monitor the PR checks synchronously when tooling permits (for example `gh pr checks --watch`). If a check fails, fix the task on the same branch, push again, and rerun checks until green.

If CI status cannot be accessed because of permissions/tooling, report that explicitly. The task is not merge-ready until required GitHub checks are green.

Stop after creating/updating the green PR. The **user performs manual UI testing, PR review, and the merge to `main`**.

1. Implementation Summary
